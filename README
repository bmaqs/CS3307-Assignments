Customers are stored in the tbl_customers. The customer_id is assigned by the server. customer_username and customer_password are not mandatory inputs and therefore may appear as blank and NULL.
Sign In and Sign Out information is stored in the tbl_SignInOut. Timestamps for SIO_timeIn and SIO_timeOut are generated by the server. SIO_id is a unique id for each entry. 
SIO_userID is a foreign key referencing tbl_customers. SIO_businessID is a foreign key referencing tbl_businesses. SIO_firstName, SIO_lastName, SIO_email, and SIO_phoneNumber are not mandatory fields and may appear as NULL.

Viewing Results for Admins

Businesses added to the database can be viewed in tbl_businesses.
